We are building a software for a store that sells three products: _apples_, _bananas_, and _oranges_. 
We need to write a function that takes the name of a product and its price as arguments and returns the price of the product with a discount applied. 
The discount should be: 
*10%* for apples and 
*20%* for bananas. 
Oranges do not have a discount.

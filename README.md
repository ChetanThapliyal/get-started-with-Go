# Go Programming Language

This repository is designed for anyone who is interested in learning GoLang. I have structured this repository to cover the basics of GoLang. It contains Go programs starting from basics to advanced, including topics like variables, control structures, functions, arrays and slices, pointers, structures, methods, and interfaces. The repository also includes solutions for problems from Leetcode and Exercism Go Track.

## Getting Started
To get started with this repository, you will need to have Go installed on your computer. 
1. You can download and install Go from the official website https://golang.org/dl/.
2. Run the installer and follow the [instructions](https://go.dev/doc/install).
3. Verify that Go is installed correctly by opening a terminal window and running the command `go version`. This should print the installed Go version.

> Official Go repo : https://github.com/golang/go

You can also try the code directly at [Go Playground](https://go.dev/play/) without installing it.

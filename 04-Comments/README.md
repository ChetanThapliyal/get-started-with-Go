# Comments in Go

Comments are used in Go to add human-readable information to the code. Comments can be single line or multi-line.

## Single Line Comments

Single line comments start with `//`. They can be used to add a single line of comment to the code.

Example:

```go
// This is a single line comment
```

## Multi-line Comments

Multi-line comments start and end with `/*` and `*/`. They can be used to add multiple lines of comment to the code.

Example:

```go
/*
This is a
multi-line comment
*/
```
